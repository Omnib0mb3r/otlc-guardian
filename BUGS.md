# BUGS — OTLC Guardian

Persistent bug log. Survives across sessions so a fresh-context agent knows what is
already known-broken before it starts troubleshooting.

### BUG-001 — `INJ-005b` fires CRITICAL on non-SQL template literals

**Status:** RESOLVED
**Found:** 2026-07-20 (originally observed 2026-04-27 against Guardian 1.3.1)
**Fixed:** 2026-07-20 (1.4.1)
**Area:** `security/03-audit.js` — `INJ-005b`

`INJ-005b` matches any template literal containing `${}` and one or more SQL-looking
words, with no awareness of the call site. Because `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `SELECT`, and
`DROP` are ordinary English words, ordinary UI strings match.

Confirmed still reproducible on 1.4.0:

```jsx
if (!window.confirm(`Delete asset ${asset.name}?`)) return;   // INJ-005b CRITICAL
return <button>{`Delete ${asset.name}`}</button>;              // INJ-005b CRITICAL
```

Real-world impact: a `guardian audit` run against a Base44-generated CMMS project
returned 6 CRITICAL findings, **all six false positives from this one rule**. In any
codebase using an ORM with no direct SQL (Base44, Supabase, Prisma), every match is a
false positive. This burns first-run trust, which is the worst possible failure mode
for a security tool.

The rule was added in 1.3.0 for a genuine reason (BUG-017, variable-indirection
bypass), so it could not simply be deleted.

**Fix (1.4.1).** The handoff proposed inverting the rule to a call-site match (only
flag templates passed to `.query(`/`.execute(`/`.raw(`). That would have been wrong:
a call-site match is exactly what `INJ-005` already does, so `INJ-005b` would have
become a duplicate and the variable-indirection bypass it exists to close would have
reopened. Declaration-site detection is the whole point of the rule.

Fixed instead by raising the evidence bar for what counts as SQL. Real SQL has clause
structure; English prose does not. Each verb now has to appear with its mandatory
companion keyword:

| Verb | Required companion |
|---|---|
| `SELECT` | `FROM` |
| `INSERT` | `INTO` |
| `UPDATE` | `SET` |
| `DELETE` | `FROM` |
| `DROP` / `ALTER` / `TRUNCATE` | `TABLE` / `DATABASE` / `INDEX` / `VIEW` / `SCHEMA` |

"Delete asset" has no `FROM`. "Failed to update record" has no `SET`. Valid SQL
essentially always carries the companion clause, so precision rose with no real
coverage loss.

Two further points the fix had to get right:

- The interpolation check is a lookahead asserting `${` appears *anywhere* in the
  template, not after the clause pair. Requiring it after `FROM` would have missed
  `` `SELECT ${columns} FROM users` ``, a genuinely unparameterized query.
- A `(?<!\bsql)` lookbehind clears the sql-guard tagged template. That tag is the
  auto-parameterizing remediation for this bug class, and flagging the fix is how you
  teach people to stop applying it. The exclusion is narrow enough that `mysql\`` and
  an untagged sibling on the next line both still fire.

No secondary lower-severity hint was added. The handoff suggested one, but a MEDIUM
noise channel reinstates the exact problem the fix removes, and the clause-pair test
is orthogonal to the call site — a custom DB wrapper is still caught as long as the
SQL it builds is really SQL.

13 tests in `tests/audit.test.js`, including a BUG-017 guard that fails if anyone ever
converts this rule to a call-site match.

### BUG-002 — No audit coverage of AI agent write permissions

**Status:** OPEN
**Found:** 2026-07-20 (originally observed 2026-04-27)
**Area:** `security/03-audit.js` — missing rule, planned as `AGT-001`

Guardian's runtime layer defends against prompt injection and output leakage. The
audit has no rules about *what AI agents are allowed to write to*.

The Zion CMMS project shipped an AI agent configured with `create`/`update`/`delete`
on `QuoteLineItem` and `update` on `Inventory`, where the only approval gate was a
politely worded sentence in the system prompt. The audit walked straight past it.

This is squarely inside the threat surface the README claims to cover, which makes it
a coverage gap with a marketing claim attached, not merely a missing feature.

Proposed rule shape and file globs in `HANDOFF-AUDIT-IMPROVEMENTS.md` § Item 2.

### BUG-003 — `INJ-003` fires on stock shadcn boilerplate

**Status:** OPEN
**Found:** 2026-07-20 (originally observed 2026-04-27)
**Area:** `security/03-audit.js` — `INJ-003`

`INJ-003` correctly flags `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, but shadcn's generated
`chart.jsx` uses it to inject static CSS variables from a constant. Every shadcn user
inherits one HIGH finding they must triage and then ignore.

The finding is technically correct and practically noise. Needs a built-in allowlist
for the exact shadcn pattern, narrow enough that a modified version of the component
still fires.

Proposal in `HANDOFF-AUDIT-IMPROVEMENTS.md` § Item 5.

### BUG-004 — Planned `DEP-001` rule id collides with the existing one

**Status:** RESOLVED
**Found:** 2026-07-20
**Fixed:** 2026-07-20
**Area:** `HANDOFF-AUDIT-IMPROVEMENTS.md` § Item 4

The handoff document proposes `DEP-001 — inconsistent npm: import versions`. That id
is already in use by `DEP-001 — No health check endpoint found`, shipped since at
least 1.2.4 and covered by tests in `tests/audit.test.js`.

Implementing the handoff as written would either silently overwrite an existing rule
or produce two rules reporting under one id, which breaks per-id filtering in JSON
consumers and CI.

**Fix.** All six `DEP-001` references in the handoff rewritten to `DEP-003`, with a
correction note at the top of Item 4 recording what changed and why. `DEP-002` remains
the committed-`.env` rule.

Unblocks BUG-006.

---

### BUG-005 — No `setTimeout`-before-query race detection

**Status:** DEFERRED
**Found:** 2026-07-20 (originally observed 2026-04-27)
**Area:** `security/03-audit.js` — missing rule, planned as `RACE-001`

`setTimeout(r, 1000)` followed by an entity lookup is a classic race: the code sleeps
a guessed interval and hopes the write has landed. Observed at
`base44/functions/inviteUser/entry.ts:29` in the Zion CMMS.

Deferred, not dismissed. The handoff explicitly allows items 3 through 6 to split
into a follow-up release. Correctness rule, not security.

Proposal in `HANDOFF-AUDIT-IMPROVEMENTS.md` § Item 3.

---

### BUG-006 — No `npm:` import version drift detection

**Status:** DEFERRED
**Found:** 2026-07-20 (originally observed 2026-04-27)
**Area:** `security/03-audit.js` — missing rule

In Deno-based projects (Base44, Supabase Edge Functions, Deno Deploy), `npm:` imports
pin a version inline, so the same package can drift across entry files. The Zion CMMS
had `@base44/sdk` at `0.8.23` and `0.8.25` across three functions.

Unblocked: BUG-004 reassigned this rule to `DEP-003`.

Proposal in `HANDOFF-AUDIT-IMPROVEMENTS.md` § Item 4.

---

### BUG-007 — No file-size / decomposition rule

**Status:** DEFERRED
**Found:** 2026-07-20 (originally observed 2026-04-27)
**Area:** `security/03-audit.js` — missing rule, planned as `QUAL-001`

`STANDARDS.md` implies decomposition; the audit does not enforce it. The Zion CMMS
shipped a 708-line page component.

Deliberately parked. The handoff itself flags this as lowest priority and notes it
shifts Guardian's identity from security tool toward style linter. If implemented it
must be default-disabled behind `--enable-quality`. That is a positioning decision,
not an engineering one, and it deserves its own explicit call.

Proposal in `HANDOFF-AUDIT-IMPROVEMENTS.md` § Item 6.

### BUG-008 — `SEC-001` missed current-format API keys

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** pre-1.1.1 · **Fixed:** 1.1.1

The pattern was `/sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}/`. The hyphen after the provider tag falls
outside `[a-zA-Z0-9]`, so matching stopped at 4 characters — far below the `{20,}`
threshold — and both `sk-proj-...` (OpenAI project keys) and `sk-ant-api03-...`
(Anthropic) were reported as clean. A leaked current-format key passed the audit with
no finding.

Split into provider-labelled rules (`SEC-001`, `SEC-010`, `SEC-001b`) so the report
names the provider that just leaked. Regression tests in `tests/audit.test.js`.

---

### BUG-009 — `ERR-001` missed comment-only catch bodies

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** pre-1.1.1 · **Fixed:** 1.1.1

The pattern required literal empty braces, so the most common lazy form
(`catch (e) { /* silent failure */ }`) was missed. A comment makes the body non-empty
to a character counter and identically harmful to error handling.

Pattern now accepts any sequence of whitespace, line comments, and block comments as
a silent body. Runs `wholeFile` so multi-line catch bodies are caught.

---

### BUG-010 — Raw SQL detection claimed but never implemented

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** pre-1.1.1 · **Fixed:** 1.1.1

The README advertised raw SQL detection. No rule implemented it. A planted fixture
containing `db.raw("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + id)` received zero findings.

Fixed by `INJ-004` (concatenation form) and `INJ-005` (template-literal form).
See BUG-017 for the follow-on bypass.

---

### BUG-011 — Connection strings with embedded credentials unflagged

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** pre-1.1.1 · **Fixed:** 1.1.1

`postgresql://admin:hunter2@db.internal:5432/prod` produced no finding despite being
a hardcoded secret by every definition in `CLAUDE.md`. Added as `SEC-011`, covering
postgres, mysql, mongodb (including `+srv`), redis/rediss, and amqp/amqps.

---

### BUG-012 — `--json` mode contaminated stdout

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** pre-1.1.1 · **Fixed:** 1.1.1 (commit `90f9665`)

Status lines such as `🔍 SAFETY AUDIT STARTING` were written to stdout in `--json`
mode, so `guardian audit . --json > out.json` produced a file that would not parse.

Status now routes to stderr in JSON mode and stdout in human mode — the standard Unix
diagnostic-vs-result split.

---

### BUG-013 — README uninstall instructions caused data loss

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** 1.3.0 · **Fixed:** 1.3.1

README line 380 told users to `rm -f CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md GEMINI.md STANDARDS.md`,
destroying any project-specific rules written before `guardian init` ran. The same bug
had already been fixed in `SETUP.md` in PR #4 but was never propagated to the README.

Replaced with a marker-based manual procedure linking to the full SETUP instructions.

---

### BUG-014 — `CFG-003` flagged safe localhost binds

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** pre-1.2.2 · **Fixed:** 1.2.2

The rule conflated two opposite things: binding a server to `127.0.0.1` (a security
best practice — refuses external connections) and a URL pointing at a hardcoded IP (a
real config leak). Flagging the safe form is actively misleading security advice.

Added `excludeLinePatterns` anchored on the syntactic shape of `listen`/`bind`/`host`
calls so they cannot match a URL string on the same line.

---

### BUG-015 — `DEP-001` fired on projects with no HTTP server

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** pre-1.2.4 · **Fixed:** 1.2.4

The rule fired on every project lacking a "health" substring, producing spurious
findings on CLI tools, static sites, libraries, notebooks, and desktop apps — none of
which should have a `/health` endpoint.

Now gated on `looksLikeHttpServer()`, which checks the manifest for a server framework
before falling back to a capped source scan for `.listen(`/`createServer(`.

---

### BUG-016 — `INJ-006` broke on Python f-strings containing inner quotes

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** pre-1.3.0 · **Fixed:** 1.3.0

The inner character class was `[^"']*`, excluding *both* quote styles. Any real-world
f-string containing a literal such as `WHERE name = 'admin'` broke the match, so the
rule silently did nothing on most production-shaped SQL.

Split into quote-specific alternation branches so each outer quote style permits the
opposite inner style.

---

### BUG-017 — `INJ-005` bypassed by variable indirection

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** pre-1.3.0 · **Fixed:** 1.3.0

`INJ-005` required the backtick template to be the first argument of the query call. A
two-line refactor defeated it entirely:

```js
const sql = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;
db.query(sql);
```

Added `INJ-005b`, which matches the declaration site rather than the call site. Both
rules are kept so a project using either form is caught.

**Caused BUG-001.** The declaration-site match has no call-site context, which is why
it over-fired on English prose until the 1.4.1 precision rewrite. The regression guard
in BUG-001's test block exists to keep this bypass closed if anyone tries to fix the
precision problem by reverting to a call-site match.

---

### BUG-018 — Subdirectory audits ignored project-root config

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** pre-1.3.1 · **Fixed:** 1.3.1

The auditor conflated the scan target with the project root. Running
`guardian audit ./src` made manifest lookups hit `./src/package.json` (nonexistent)
and silently ignored the central allowlist at `<root>/security/.audit-allowlist`.

Split into `scanRoot` (what the user asked to scan) and `projectRoot` (found by
walking upward for `.git`, the allowlist, or a manifest, capped at 8 levels).

---

### BUG-019 — Hooks bypassed the runtime guard's decode passes

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** 1.3.0 · **Fixed:** 1.3.1

Both Claude Code hooks walked the raw `INJECTION_PATTERNS` array directly, bypassing
the runtime guard's NFKC normalization, invisible-Unicode stripping, URL-decode, and
base64-decode passes. A fullwidth-Unicode or percent-encoded injection payload slipped
past the hooks even though a direct `scan()` call caught it.

Both hooks now import and call the public `scan()`. Hook coverage is byte-for-byte
identical to runtime coverage.

---

### BUG-020 — FastAPI dependency returned unsanitized input

**Status:** RESOLVED · **Found:** 1.3.0 · **Fixed:** 1.3.1

The Python FastAPI dependency scanned input but returned the original value rather
than the sanitized one, so callers received unsanitized text while believing it had
been through the guard. Soft-breaking change for FastAPI users; see the 1.3.1
CHANGELOG entry.
